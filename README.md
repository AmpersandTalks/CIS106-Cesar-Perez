# CIS 106 Cesar Perez

## Assignment 1

I am currently taking this course to learn how to use the programming coding language Python. The reason I want to learn Python is to further help my understanding of the coding language. I am also taking this class to complete my IT associate's degree as it is a requirement to complete CIS 106. I've always been fascinated with how far coding language has gone. I initially decided to learn JavaScript but felt like there was much of a learning curve as opposed to learning Python. As It is a recommended language for beginners as it is a basic language that can be a foundation to help me better understand other languages. 

## Assignment 2

The Programming language of choice that I would like to learn during this course would have to be Python. The reason why I want to learn this programming language is that I want to further my knowledge of Programming languages. I currently have some experience in coding JavaScript but felt as the code language was a bit hard at times. I believe once I learn how to Code using Python I will be able to better understand the foundation of programming languages and possibly be able to learn different languages in the futue. In regards to choosing an IDEs program, I  decided on using Paiza.io as the IDEs of my choice for this course. I have used Visual Studio before but I like Paiza.io's interface a bit better.

## Assignment 3

Session 3 was really interesting because we were able to use more of the mechanics that Flowgorithm uses. The activities helped me better understand variables and how to better use the variable options on Flowgorithm. I also learned all the different data types and how to declare different variables such as integers are whole numbers, floating points are for fractional numbers, strings are for a sequence of characters, Boolean is for logical true or false, and nothing/null for no data. This assignment is the first assignment where we also create a more elaborate program as opposed to the last assignment.

## Assignment 4

Session 4 focuses on implementing what we learned in the previous assignment and apply it while writing in the preferred programing language. I struggled to write in Python but adapted by looking back at examples. Using Visual Studio Code I was able to figure out the mistakes that I was making and correcting them accordingly. GitHub's testing also was helpful as it lines out what type of errors are present in each assignment. One of the errors that I received was that I was not using snake_case but was using camelCase. This error helped me make the corrections I needed to complete the assignment correctly. These assignments were a great introduction to getting used to learning how to code Python without using Flowgotrithm. 

## Assignment 5

Session 5 focuses on functions that are described as a block of organized code that performs one task. Something that I learned was how Flowgorithm was able to add more functions and manage them through the functions manager tool in Flowgorithm. This method condenses the code into one function and can reference it back to a different function. This chapter was not as difficult there was just a couple of new things that I learned activities were similar to Assignment 3 but used more than one function. Something that I learned was that modularization has the advantages such as developing programs more efficiently and quicker and makes it easier for debugging and modifying code this was apparent especially when I making errors I was able to pinpoint where my errors were much easier.
