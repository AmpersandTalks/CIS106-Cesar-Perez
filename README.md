# CIS 106 Cesar Perez

## Assignment 1

I am currently taking this course to learn how to use the programming code JavaScript. The reason I want to learn JavaScript is to further help my endeavors to use it for Web Development. I am also taking this class to complete my IT associate's degree as it is a requirement to complete CIS 106. I've always been fascinated with how far coding language has gone. When I was a Senior in high school had a project where we needed to code a Raspberry Pi board. Since then I've been fascinated and eager to learn how to code but never knew where to start or the fundamentals. I am excited to see what I learn and how I can apply it to my Profession.

## Assignment 2

The Programming language of choice that I would like to learn during this course would have to be JavaScript. The reason why I want to learn this programming language is that I want to further my knowledge in web development. I currently have some experience in coding HTML and CSS, but I am missing JavaScript. I believe once I learn how to Code using JavaScript It will be able to bring some of the ideas I have for websites to life. In regards to choosing an IDEs program, I  decided on using PlayCode.io as the IDEs of my choice for this course. I have used Visual Studio before but I like PlayCode.io's interface.

## Assignment 3

Session 3 was really interesting because we were ble to use more of the emchanics that Flowgorithm uses. The acivities helped me better understand variables and how to better use the variable options on Flowgorithm. I also learned all the different data types and how to declar different variables usch as intergers are whole numbers, floating points are for fractional numbers, strings is for a sequence of characters, Boolean are for logical true or false, and nothing/null for no data. This information was something that stuck with me because when working on activity 7 the main error that I was coming accross was that I was declaring the dog name as an interger instead of a string. this will better help me with future activities. 

## Assignment 4

Session 4 was a bit difficult because I was not used to writing in my programming language. I initially struggled to write with JavaScript but adapted by looking back to examples. Using my online IDE I was able to figure out the mistakes that I was making and correcting them accordingly. One of the following errors I was receiving was a PHP parse syntax error. I did not realize that I was missing a variable when defining Yards, feet, and inches. this example taught me that I should be more careful when coding and revise the code extensively as one mistake can stop an operation and cause the code to stop. I was relieved when the code I had written had worked and the prompt box appeared and the output box with the results.

## Assignment 5

Session 5 was a bit of a surprise as we went over functions which are described as a block of organized code that performs one task. Something that I learned was how Flowgorithm was able to add more functions and manage them through the functions manager tool in Flowgorithm. This method condenses the code in one function and can reference it back to different functions. This chapter was not as difficult there was just a couple of new things that I learned but code was very similar to Assignment 3. Something that I learned was that modularization has the advantages such as developing programs more efficiently and quicker and makes it easier for debugging and modifying code this was apparent especially when I making errors I was able to pinpoint where my errors were much easier.

## Assignment 6

Session 6 Felt Similar to Session 4, this is because this session focuses on our understanding and learning in writing code that executes the same activities from session 3, but this time implementing functions that were introduced in session 5. Session 6 was not difficult at all because they're a lot of resources that assist in learning how to code with our programing language. When working on the activities I learned that it is important to keep an eye for any typos when assigning names to functions. I was getting an error where I was not able to find the function because it was missing a character. revising and testing the code multiple times before submitting is important. This occurred to me the last session where Flowgorithm was making an error every time it would covert the pseudo-code into JavaScript It was capitalizing ToString. This is incorrect and will keep an eye on any other mistakes like these.
