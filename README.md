# CIS 106 Cesar Perez

## Assignment 1

I am currently taking this course to learn how to use the programming coding language Python. The reason I want to learn Python is to further help my understanding of the coding language. I am also taking this class to complete my IT associate's degree as it is a requirement to complete CIS 106. I've always been fascinated with how far coding language has gone. I initially decided to learn JavaScript but felt like there was much of a learning curve as opposed to learning python. As It is a recommended language for beginners as it is a basic language that can be a foundation to help me better understand other languages. 

## Assignment 2

The Programming language of choice that I would like to learn during this course would have to be Python. The reason why I want to learn this programming language is that I want to further my knowledge of Programming languages. I currently have some experience in coding JavaScript but felt as the code language was a bit hard at times. I believe once I learn how to Code using Python I will be able to better understand the foundation of programming languages and possibly be able to learn different languages in the futue. In regards to choosing an IDEs program, I  decided on using Paiza.io as the IDEs of my choice for this course. I have used Visual Studio before but I like Paiza.io's interface a bit better.
