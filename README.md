# CIS 106 Cesar Perez

## Assignment 1

I am currently taking this course to learn how to use the programming coding language Python. The reason I want to learn Python is to further help my understanding of the coding language. I am also taking this class to complete my IT associate's degree as it is a requirement to complete CIS 106. I've always been fascinated with how far coding language has gone. I initially decided to learn JavaScript but felt like there was much of a learning curve as opposed to learning python. As It is a recommended language for beginners as it is a basic language that can be a foundation to help me better understand other languages. 

## Assignment 2

The Programming language of choice that I would like to learn during this course would have to be Python. The reason why I want to learn this programming language is that I want to further my knowledge of Programming languages. I currently have some experience in coding JavaScript but felt as the code language was a bit hard at times. I believe once I learn how to Code using Python I will be able to better understand the foundation of programming languages and possibly be able to learn different languages in the futue. In regards to choosing an IDEs program, I  decided on using Paiza.io as the IDEs of my choice for this course. I have used Visual Studio before but I like Paiza.io's interface a bit better.

## Assignment 3

Session 3 was really interesting because we were able to use more of the mechanics that Flowgorithm uses. The activities helped me better understand variables and how to better use the variable options on Flowgorithm. I also learned all the different data types and how to declare different variables such as integers are whole numbers, floating points are for fractional numbers, strings are for a sequence of characters, Boolean is for logical true or false, and nothing/null for no data. This assignment is the first assignment where we also create a more elaborate program as opposed to the last assignment.
