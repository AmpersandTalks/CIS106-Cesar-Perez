# CIS 106 Cesar Perez

## Assignment 1

I am currently taking this course to learn how to use the programming code JavaScript. The reason I want to learn JavaScript is to further help my endeavors to use it for Web Development. I am also taking this class to complete my IT associate's degree as it is a requirement to complete CIS 106. I've always been fascinated with how far coding language has gone. When I was a Senior in high school had a project where we needed to code a Raspberry Pi board. Since then I've been fascinated and eager to learn how to code but never knew where to start or the fundamentals. I am excited to see what I learn and how I can apply it to my Profession.

## Assignment 2

The Programming language of choice that I would like to learn during this course would have to be JavaScript. The reason why I want to learn this programming language is that I want to further my knowledge in web development. I currently have some experience in coding HTML and CSS, but I am missing JavaScript. I believe once I learn how to Code using JavaScript It will be able to bring some of the ideas I have for websites to life. In regards to choosing an IDEs program, I  decided on using PlayCode.io as the IDEs of my choice for this course. I have used Visual Studio before but I like PlayCode.io's interface.

## Assignment 3

Session 3 was really interesting because we were ble to use more of the emchanics that Flowgorithm uses. The acivities helped me better understand variables and how to better use the variable options on Flowgorithm. I also learned all the different data types and how to declar different variables usch as intergers are whole numbers, floating points are for fractional numbers, strings is for a sequence of characters, Boolean are for logical true or false, and nothing/null for no data. This information was something that stuck with me because when working on activity 7 the main error that I was coming accross was that I was declaring the dog name as an interger instead of a string. this will better help me with future activities.
