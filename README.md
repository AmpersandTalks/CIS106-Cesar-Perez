# CIS 106 Cesar Perez

## Assignment 1

I am currently taking this course to learn how to use the programming coding language Python. The reason I want to learn Python is to further help my understanding of the coding language. I am also taking this class to complete my IT associate's degree as it is a requirement to complete CIS 106. I've always been fascinated with how far coding language has gone. I initially decided to learn JavaScript but felt like there was much of a learning curve as opposed to learning Python. As It is a recommended language for beginners as it is a basic language that can be a foundation to help me better understand other languages. 

## Assignment 2

The Programming language of choice that I would like to learn during this course would have to be Python. The reason why I want to learn this programming language is that I want to further my knowledge of Programming languages. I currently have some experience in coding JavaScript but felt as the code language was a bit hard at times. I believe once I learn how to Code using Python I will be able to better understand the foundation of programming languages and possibly be able to learn different languages in the futue. In regards to choosing an IDEs program, I  decided on using Paiza.io as the IDEs of my choice for this course. I have used Visual Studio before but I like Paiza.io's interface a bit better.

## Assignment 3

Session 3 was really interesting because we were able to use more of the mechanics that Flowgorithm uses. The activities helped me better understand variables and how to better use the variable options on Flowgorithm. I also learned all the different data types and how to declare different variables such as integers are whole numbers, floating points are for fractional numbers, strings are for a sequence of characters, Boolean is for logical true or false, and nothing/null for no data. This assignment is the first assignment where we also create a more elaborate program as opposed to the last assignment.

## Assignment 4

Session 4 focuses on implementing what we learned in the previous assignment and apply it while writing in the preferred programing language. I struggled to write in Python but adapted by looking back at examples. Using Visual Studio Code I was able to figure out the mistakes that I was making and correcting them accordingly. GitHub's testing also was helpful as it lines out what type of errors are present in each assignment. One of the errors that I received was that I was not using snake_case but was using camelCase. This error helped me make the corrections I needed to complete the assignment correctly. These assignments were a great introduction to getting used to learning how to code Python without using Flowgotrithm. 

## Assignment 5

Session 5 focuses on functions that are described as a block of organized code that performs one task. Something that I learned was how Flowgorithm was able to add more functions and manage them through the functions manager tool in Flowgorithm. This method condenses the code into one function and can reference it back to a different function. This chapter was not as difficult there was just a couple of new things that I learned activities were similar to Assignment 3 but used more than one function. Something that I learned was that modularization has the advantages such as developing programs more efficiently and quicker and makes it easier for debugging and modifying code this was apparent especially when I making errors I was able to pinpoint where my errors were much easier.

## Assignment 6

Session 6 uses the same concepts as in Session 5, but this time using the knowledge from session 5 to code in our preferred language. Session 6 was not difficult at all in the sense of getting the program to work but instead getting the formatting of my code correctly was a bit hard. They're a lot of resources that assist in learning how to format your programing language. When working on the activities I learned that it is important to keep an eye for any typos when assigning names to functions. I was getting an error where I was not able to find the function because it was missing a character. revising and testing the code multiple times before submitting is important. This occurred to me in the last session where Flowgorithm was making an error every time it would covert the pseudo-code into JavaScript It was capitalizing ToString. This is incorrect and will keep an eye on any other mistakes like these. 

## Assignment 7

Assignment 7 introduces the concept of conditions as well as learning how to implement the IF statements. When working on activity 1 I realized that less than or greater than can be used for IF statements, this helped a lot when building the program that calculates overtime for activity 1. Using the general knowledge from previous assignments helped a lot when planning and building the program for both assignments. A part where I got stuck was when working on activity 1. I planned on asking if the person had worked overtime as the choice in the beginning. I would then use the IF statement to determine the process and the calculation. The idea was dismissed because the activity required calculating the amount of money made for Overtime hours. This is where I decided to ask for the number of hours worked and use greater than or less than on the IF statement.

## Assignment 8

Assignment 8 focuses on the For loop function. Assignment 8 is an introduction to Logic loops Activity 1 was not much of a challenge because I was able to use Flowgorithm to plan out my program. Something that I did struggle with was activity 2 I was not able to get the increment to go up correctly. I believe that the For loop is on the more complicated side of loops. I feel this way because the for loops increment through a range of values. As opposed to the other loops that require an expression to be checked to execute what is inside the loop.


## Assignment 9

Assignment 9 focuses on the while Loop function. Assignment 9 is a continuation on logic loops but instead of using them for a loop. Both activities were not as hard because of the knowledge from the previous assignments. Something that was different from this assignment and the previous assignment on For loops was the different condition that is required for the loop to keep executing the fields inside the loop. The While loop allows for Boolean expressions to be written as a condition for the loop. Something that I did realize to struggle with was getting the loop to loop the conditions the appropriate amount of times. this was due to the fact that the For loop does not require an increment variable to exist. I was able to figure out the error and fixed it immediately 

## Assignment 10

Assignment 10 focuses on the Do loop. Similar to the previous sessions it was initially a bit of a challenge, but knowledge from previous loops helped to understand how the Do Loop works. I decided to go back to the example that was provided to better understand all the loops. This helped me better understand the Do loop better and how it works. I decided to go with working on activity 1 which was similar to activity one in session 8. This helped me visualize and formant the structure for the Do loop. Session 10-second activity was about nested loops. this activity was a bit more difficult due to the fact that there was no example to refer back to. I decided to read and visit the additional resources to help me better visualize the structure for the nested loop.

## Assignment 11

Assignment 11 focuses on Arrays. This session uses the knowledge from the previous sessions to plan for these assignments. An array is described as a data structure consisting of a collection of elements. Assignment 11 also requires a fixed array and a defined array. I found the different types of arrays a bit confusing but referenced back to the course material for further clarification. Something that I learned from this session was that the index range has to be from 0 to the desired amount that the user would enter. This is s something that is covered in the chapter but can be missed easily when writing the code.

## Assignment 12

Session 12 is about dynamic arrays. The dynamic array has no static length but it can be extended till the user wants to add an element to the array. This section also described different functions to access the list. Linear search is a method to find an element in the list. This is also known as a sequential search. Max and min is a function to retrieve the maximum and minimum element from the array. We have also learned about the sorting algorithm, which allows sorting arrays in ascending order or descending order. The dynamic array allows us to add and remove an element from any index of the list. this session was a bit easier as the last session had introduced the foundations of arrays.

## Assignment 13

In session 13, strings are introduced. The session describes A string as a collection of characters. Assignment 13 activity two helped me realize how simple the reversal string function was. The Issue That I had come across was making sure that the program would delete any duplicate spacing. This issue was then fixed by adding the strip function which Removes leading and trailing spaces from a string. the second activity that I chose was activity 1 which was a bit more on the harder side due to the fact that it required for the input text to be displayed as last name, first initial. both first letters being capitalized. Initially, I decided to plan out what functions to use this led me to use the capitalized function instead of the upper function due to the fact that the upper function would capitalize all letters.
