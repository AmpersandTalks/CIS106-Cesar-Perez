# CIS 106 Cesar Perez

## Assignment 1

I am currently taking this course to learn how to use the programming coding language Python. The reason I want to learn Python is to further help my understanding of the coding language. I am also taking this class to complete my IT associate's degree as it is a requirement to complete CIS 106. I've always been fascinated with how far coding language has gone. I initially decided to learn JavaScript but felt like there was much of a learning curve as opposed to learning python. As It is a recommended language for beginners as it is a basic language that can be a foundation to help me better understand other languages.
