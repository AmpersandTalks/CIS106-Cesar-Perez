# CIS 106 Cesar Perez

## Assignment 1

I am currently taking this course to learn how to use the programming code JavaScript. The reason I want to learn Java script is to further help my endeavors to use it for Web Development. I am also taking this class to complete my IT associate's degree as it is a requirement to complete CIS 106. I've always been fascinated with how far coding language has gone. When I was a Senior in high school had a project where we needed to code a raspberry pi board. Since then I've been fascinated and eager to learn how to code but never knew where to start or the fundamentals. I am excited to see what I learn and how I can apply it to my proffession.
